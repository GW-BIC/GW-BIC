The mission of the Biomedical Informatics Center is to leverage biomedical information, including EHR, social media, and omics data, to predict and improve patient outcomes by developing and using cutting-edge computational technology.

With the advent of electronic health records (EHR) and health databases in hospitals and other clinical settings, the effective use of patient data has become a prominent focus for researchers at the intersection of healthcare and technology. The goal of biomedical informatics research, as well as the mission of the GW Biomedical Informatics Center, is to develop methods for leveraging this data to predict and improve patient outcomes.

Biomedical informatics research has wide-reaching impacts on a variety of health issues. GW Biomedical Informatics Center faculty have studied topics such as antibiotic resistance, cancer, dementia, health literacy, frailty in elderly patients, systemic sclerosis, and health disparity in underrepresented populations. This research has been used to identify factors that are tied to outcomes such as increased patient adherence to medicine or discharge instructions, quality of life, or mortality. To learn more about the broad scope of biomedical informatics research, read about our current projects.
